# PeekLink

A powerful Chrome extension that lets you preview links, articles, and videos on the current page without opening a new tab. Boost your productivity by peeking into content instantly.

## Features

-   **Instant Link Preview**: Hover over any link to see its content in a sleek, draggable, and resizable popup window.
-   **Reading Mode**: Strips away ads and clutter, presenting articles in a clean, readable format.
-   **Pinning**: Pin a preview window to keep it fixed on the screen while you scroll the page.
-   **Multi-Link Preview**: Open and manage previews for multiple links simultaneously to compare content.
-   **Quick Actions**: Right-click selected text to instantly search with Google or translate with Google Translate.
-   **Smart Fallback**: If a site (like YouTube or GitHub) blocks embedding, the extension automatically attempts to load it in Reading Mode.
